# Machine-Learning-Final-Task

This repository is for my final submission for the IBM Machine Learning with Python course, completed in May 2022.

There are four main sections to this submission:

- K Nearest Neighbor(KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine
- Logistic Regression

Following these sections, the four different models are evaluated using a test data set, and scored on their Jaccard similarity score, and F1 accuracy.
